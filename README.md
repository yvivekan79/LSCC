# Layered Sharding with Cross-Channel Consensus (LSCC)

LSCC is a hybrid blockchain scalability solution that integrates the strengths of both on-chain solutions (like sharding) and off-chain solutions (like state channels) to optimize transaction throughput, latency, and cross-shard communication.

## Overview

This implementation is based on the academic paper "A Hybrid Scalability Solution for Blockchain: Layered Sharding with Cross-Channel Consensus (LSCC)" and provides a functioning blockchain network with:

- Multi-layered sharding architecture
- Cross-channel consensus for inter-shard communication
- Dynamic node assignment to shards
- Relay nodes for efficient cross-shard transactions
- Basic Proof-of-Stake consensus

## Key Features

- **Layered Sharding**: Multiple layers of shards to balance transaction load
- **Cross-Channel Consensus**: Efficient cross-shard communication mechanism
- **Relay Nodes**: Specialized nodes for facilitating cross-shard transactions
- **Flexible Architecture**: Support for different consensus mechanisms and sharding strategies

## Architecture

The LSCC architecture consists of the following main components:

1. **Core**: Basic blockchain data structures (blocks, transactions)
2. **Sharding**: Sharding management and cross-shard communication
3. **Consensus**: Consensus mechanisms (PoS implementation)
4. **Network**: P2P networking and message handling
5. **Config**: Configuration management
6. **Utils**: Utility functions and logging

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.16 or later

### Building the Project

Build the project:

```bash
go build -o lscc-node
```

### Running a Node

Run a node with default configuration:

```bash
./lscc-node
```

Or with custom configuration:

```bash
./lscc-node --config=config.json --port=8001 --nodeid=my-node-1 --relay=true
```

## Configuration

Sample configuration (config.json):

```json
{
  "node_id": "lscc-test-node",
  "port": 8000,
  "bootstrap_nodes": [],
  "is_relay": true,
  "shard_id": 0,
  "shard_count": 4,
  "cross_shard_ratio": 20,
  "relay_nodes_ratio": 10,
  "layer_count": 3,
  "nodes_per_shard": 10,
  "sharding_strategy": 0,
  "consensus_type": "pos",
  "block_time": 5,
  "min_confirmations": 6,
  "max_transactions_per_block": 1000,
  "cross_channel_verify": true,
  "connection_timeout": 30,
  "sync_interval": 60,
  "peer_limit": 50,
  "data_dir": "./data"
}
```
