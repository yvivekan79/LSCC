### 4. Key Processes

#### 4.1 Transaction Flow

1. **Transaction Creation**: 
   - User creates transaction via CLI or API
   - Transaction is signed and assigned a type (regular or cross-shard)

2. **Transaction Validation**:
   - Basic validation (signature, format, etc.)
   - Balance check for sender
   - Nonce validation to prevent replays

3. **Transaction Processing**:
   - Regular transactions added to local shard mempool
   - Cross-shard transactions sent to shard manager

4. **Cross-Shard Handling**:
   - Source shard records the outgoing transaction
   - Cross-channel propagates transaction to target shard
   - Once enough cross-shard transactions accumulate, a relay block is created
   - Relay block is verified by relay nodes across affected shards
   - Target shard processes the transaction when relay block is validated

5. **Block Creation**:
   - Validator selected via PoS algorithm
   - Validator creates block with transactions from mempool
   - Block is propagated to other nodes in the shard
   - Nodes validate and add the block to their chain

#### 4.2 Node Initialization

1. Node configuration loaded from file or defaults
2. Node ID generated if not provided
3. Connection to bootstrap nodes (if specified)
4. Shard assignment based on configuration or auto-assignment
5. Blockchain initialized for the assigned shard
6. P2P server started to accept connections
7. Block synchronization with peers
8. If relay node, additional cross-shard responsibilities initialized

#### 4.3 Sharding Strategy Implementation

1. **Static Sharding**:
   - Fixed number of shards
   - Nodes assigned to shards based on node ID hash
   - No rebalancing of nodes between shards

2. **Dynamic Sharding**:
   - Variable number of shards based on network load
   - Nodes can be reassigned based on performance metrics
   - Automatic shard splitting/merging when thresholds are reached

3. **Hybrid Sharding**:
   - Combination of static and dynamic approaches
   - Core shards remain static for stability
   - Additional shards created dynamically as needed

#### 4.4 Cross-Channel Consensus

1. Cross-shard transaction identified and routed to shard manager
2. Transaction added to cross-shard queue for target shard
3. When queue reaches threshold, relay block created
4. Relay block contains cross-shard transactions and metadata
5. Relay nodes validate relay block across affected shards
6. When sufficient validations received, relay block committed
7. Target shard processes transactions from validated relay block
8. Source shard updated with cross-shard transaction status

### 5. Configuration Parameters

The system can be configured via command-line flags or a configuration file:

```json
{
  "node_id": "auto-generated-if-empty",
  "port": 8000,
  "bootstrap_nodes": ["ip:port", "ip:port"],
  "is_relay": false,
  "shard_id": -1,
  "data_dir": "./data",
  "stake_amount": 100.0,
  "min_validators": 1,
  "block_time": 5,
  "max_transactions_per_block": 100,
  "relay_threshold": 10,
  "validation_threshold": 3,
  "shard_count": 12,
  "layer_count": 3
}
```

### 6. Performance Considerations

#### 6.1 Scalability

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding more shards increases throughput linearly
- **Layer Organization**: Hierarchical arrangement of shards improves management
- **Cross-Shard Overhead**: Minimized through batching in relay blocks

#### 6.2 Latency

- **Intra-Shard Transactions**: Low latency (single-shard consensus)
- **Cross-Shard Transactions**: Higher latency due to relay mechanism
- **Relay Threshold**: Configurable to balance throughput vs. latency

#### 6.3 Security

- **Validator Selection**: PoS mechanism with stake requirements
- **Cross-Shard Attacks**: Prevented through relay node validation
- **Shard Takeover Resistance**: Achieved through validator distribution

### 7. Future Enhancements

1. **Improved Dynamic Sharding**: More sophisticated load balancing
2. **Advanced Cross-Shard Optimizations**: Reduce latency for cross-shard transactions
3. **Smart Contract Support**: Extend to support distributed application execution
4. **Privacy Enhancements**: Zero-knowledge proof integration
5. **Formal Verification**: Mathematical verification of consensus correctness
