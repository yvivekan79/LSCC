# LSCC: Layered Sharding with Cross-Channel Consensus

## Technical Specification Document

### 1. Introduction

LSCC (Layered Sharding with Cross-Channel Consensus) is a blockchain scalability solution designed to address the throughput and latency limitations of traditional blockchain systems. This document provides a detailed technical overview of the LSCC implementation.

### 2. System Architecture

#### 2.1 Overview

The LSCC architecture consists of the following main components:

1. **Core Blockchain**: Basic blockchain data structures and functionality
2. **Sharding Layer**: Division of the blockchain into multiple shards
3. **Consensus Mechanism**: Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus within shards
4. **Cross-Channel Consensus**: Mechanism for cross-shard communication and transaction processing
5. **Networking Layer**: Node-to-node communication and data propagation
6. **CLI Interface**: Command-line interface for interacting with the system

### 3. Core Components

#### 3.1 Core Package (`core/`)

The core package contains the fundamental blockchain data structures and operations.

##### 3.1.1 Block (`block.go`)

A block is the basic unit of the blockchain, containing a set of transactions:

```go
type Block struct {
    Height        uint64
    Timestamp     int64
    PrevBlockHash string
    Hash          string
    Transactions  []*Transaction
    Validator     string
    Signature     string
    ShardID       int
}
```

Key functionalities:
- Block creation, validation, and serialization
- Hash calculation and cryptographic verification
- Genesis block generation for each shard

##### 3.1.2 Transaction (`transaction.go`)

Represents an individual transaction within the blockchain:

```go
type Transaction struct {
    From        string
    To          string
    Amount      float64
    Fee         float64
    Timestamp   int64
    Hash        string
    Signature   string
    SourceShard int
    TargetShard int
    Nonce       uint64
    Type        int
}
```

Key functionalities:
- Transaction creation and validation
- Digital signature support
- Cross-shard transaction identification and handling

##### 3.1.3 Blockchain (`blockchain.go`)

The main blockchain data structure:

```go
type Blockchain struct {
    Blocks      []*Block
    Mempool     []*Transaction
    ShardID     int
    NodeID      string
    mu          sync.RWMutex
    logger      *utils.Logger
    Validators  map[string]float64
    Config      *config.Config
}
```

Key functionalities:
- Block addition and validation
- Transaction selection and block creation
- Chain state querying and manipulation
- Mempool management for pending transactions

#### 3.2 Consensus Package (`consensus/`)

Implements the consensus mechanisms for reaching agreement on blockchain state.

##### 3.2.1 Proof of Stake (`pos.go`)

```go
type PoSConsensus struct {
    Blockchain  *core.Blockchain
    Validators  map[string]float64
    StakeAmount map[string]float64
    mu          sync.RWMutex
    logger      *utils.Logger
}
```

Key functionalities:
- Validator selection based on stake
- Block validation according to PoS rules
- Reward distribution to validators
- Slashing mechanism for malicious validators
